# Application description

## Problem statement
I want to be able to work on a project with a small team. I want to be able to have tasks that have a description of what they are, and be able to assign them to a team member. The team member should work on that task until it is complete. 

## User stories

### Create project
As a project manager, I want to be able to create a project and team members to that project so that we can start working on it together.

`Test synchronous communication between modules`

### View dashboard
As a project manager, I want to see what is the number of projects I have and the date my account was created. 

`Test API composition from the application module`

### Notify me when someone changes the status of a project
When a project is suspended or closed, I want to be notified via email with who did it so that I can stay up to date.
